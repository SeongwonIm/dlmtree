Description: Functions to estimate and interpret treed distributed lag models (DLMs). The methods estimate constrained DLMs using the
  Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) framework. Includes various extensions of treed DLMs. These include: 
  treed DLMs and distributed lag mixture models as described in Mork and Wilson (2023) <doi: 10.1111/biom.13568>; 
  treed distributed lag nonlinear models as described in Mork and Wilson (2021) <doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa051>;
  heterogeneous DLMs as described in Mork et al. (2024) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2023.2258595>. The package also includes a Shiny App to help interpret results.
