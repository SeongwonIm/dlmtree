Description: The 'dlmtree' R package provides constrained distributed lag models (DLMs) using a regression tree approach 
  within the Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) framework, referred to as treed DLMs. The package includes various extensions of treed DLMs, 
  allowing for the incorporation of different scenarios like linear/non-linear associations, mixture exposures, and heterogeneous exposure effects.
