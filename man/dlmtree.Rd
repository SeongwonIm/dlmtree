named list containing equally sized numerical matrices of exposure data having same length as data}

controlling dlm tree depth. default: alpha = 0.95, beta = 2}

\item{dlmtree.step.prob}{numerical vector for probability of each step for dlm tree updates: of 1) grow/prune,
2) change, 3) switch exposure, defaults to (0.25, 0.25, 0.25)}

\item{binomial.size}{integer type scalar (if all equal, default = 1) or
vector defining binomial size for 'logit' family}

\item{formula.zi}{(Only applies to family = 'zinb') object of class formula, a symbolic description of the fixed effect of
zero-inflated (ZI) model to be fitted, e.g. y ~ a + b. This only applies to ZINB where covariates for
ZI model are different from NB model. This is set to the NB formula unless stated otherwise.
response with logit link, or 'zinb' for zero-inflated negative binomial with logit link}

\item{tdlnm.exposure.splits}{scalar indicating the number of splits (divided
evenly across quantiles of the exposure data) or list with two components:
'type' = 'values' or 'quantiles', and 'split.vals' = a numerical
vector indicating the corresponding exposure values or quantiles for splits.}

\item{tdlnm.time.split.prob}{probability vector of a spliting probabilities for time lags. The default is uniform probabilities.}

\item{tdlnm.exposure.se}{numerical matrix of exposure standard errors with same
size as exposure.data or a scalar smoothing factor representing a uniform
smoothing factor applied to each exposure measurement, defaults to sd(exposure.data)/2}

\item{hdlm.modifiers}{string vector containing desired modifiers to be included in a modifier tree.
The strings in the vector must match the names of the columns of the data. By default, a modifier tree considers all covariates as modifiers unless stated otherwise.}

\item{hdlm.dlmtree.type}{specification of dlmtree type for HDLM: shared (default) or nested}

\item{hdlm.selection.prior}{scalar hyperparameter for sparsity of modifiers. Must be between 0.5 and 1.
Smaller value corresponds to increased sparsity of modifiers.}

\item{mixture.interactions}{'noself' (default) which estimates interactions only between two
different exposures, 'all' which also allows interactions within the same exposure, or 'none'
which eliminates all interactions and estimates only main effects of each exposure}

\item{mixture.prior}{positive scalar hyperparameter for sparsity of exposures}

\item{monotone.gamma0}{vector (with length equal to number of lags) of means for logit-transformed prior probability of split at each lag;
e.g., gamma_0l = 0 implies mean prior probability of split at lag l = 0.5}

\item{monotone.sigma}{symmetric matrix (usually with only diagonal elements) corresponding to gamma_0 to define variances on prior probability of split;
e.g., gamma_0l=0 with lth diagonal element of sigma=2.701 implies that 95\% of the time the prior probability of split is between 0.005 and 0.995,
as a second example setting gamma_0l=4.119 and the corresponding diagonal element of sigma=0.599 implies that 95\% of the time the prior probability of a split is between 0.8 and 0.99}

\item{monotone.tree.time.params}{BART parameters for monotone time tree}

\item{monotone.tree.exp.params}{BART parameters for monotone exposure tree}

\item{monotone.time.kappa}{scaling factor in dirichlet prior that goes alongside \code{tdlnm.time.split.prob} to
control the amount of prior information given to the model for deciding probabilities of splits between adjacent lags}

\item{subset}{integer vector to analyze only a subset of data and exposures}

\item{save.data}{true (default): save data used for fitting the model}

\item{lowmem}{false (default) / true: turn on memory saver for DLNM, slower computation time}

\item{verbose}{true (default) or false: print output}

\item{diagnostics}{true or false (default) keep model diagnostic such as the number of
terminal nodes and acceptance ratio.}

\item{initial.params}{initial parameters for fixed effects model, FALSE = none (default),
"glm" = generate using GLM, or user defined, length must equal number of parameters in fixed effects model}

\description{
The 'dlmtree' function accommodates various response variable types, including continuous, binary, and zero-inflated count values.
The function is designed to handle both single exposure and exposure mixtures. For a single exposure, users are offered options to model non-linear effects (tdlnm),
linear effects (tdlm), or heterogenous subgroup/individualized effects (hdlm). In the case of exposure mixtures, the function supports
lagged interactions (tdlmm), and heterogenous subgroup/individualized effects (hdlmm) allowing for a comprehensive exploration of mixture exposure heterogeneity.
Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters to impose effect shrinkage and perform exposure selection, enhancing the adaptability and precision of the modeling process.

\details{
dlmtree

Model is recommended to be run for at minimum 5000 burn-in
iterations followed by 15000 sampling iterations with a thinning factor of 5.
Convergence can be checked by re-running the model and validating consistency
of results. Examples are provided below for the syntax for running different types of models.
