# dlmtree
R package for the estimation of distributed lag linear and non-linear models. The methods used here improve the precision of critical window identification compared to methods that use spline or penalized spline basis functions. 

This package includes code to accompany the following paper:

-Treed Distributed Lag Non-Linear Models ([code example](https://danielmork.github.io/dlmtree/TDLNM_Example.html))

-Treed Distributed Lag Mixture Models ([code example](https://danielmork.github.io/dlmtree/TDLMM_Example.html))

-Treed Distributed Lag Mixture Models ([adjusting for changes in co-exposures](https://danielmork.github.io/dlmtree/TDLMM_adj_coexp.html))
